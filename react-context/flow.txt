sign-up:
 when the user sign-ups their password is hashed, then the db is queried to POST the hashed password and username

sign-in:
  When the user signs in,  they put in their username and password, the code checks to see if their is a missing field.
  After this, the db is queried to find the user with the username put in the field.
  if the user exists, the user will get verified with the password they put in the field and the hashedpassword in the db.
  if they password the user inputed is verified or (isMatched) then they'll recieve a token which gives access to the site.

stay-in:
  upon sing-in, the user is given their token which authorizes them.
  This token is stored in local storage, so when the user refreshes componentDidMount is called since the page is refreshed and
  render is called for the "first" time.
  when CDM is called it checks if the token exists, if it does exist then user within state is kept to ur decoded token which says ur a valid user and can stay

sign-out:
  when the user clicks sign out, handlesignout is called which removes the token from localStorage and sets the state prop user to null.
